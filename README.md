## Pokédex

Displays an infinitely scrolling list of Pokémon from https://pokeapi.co/docsv1/.

### TODO

- [x] React/Redux
- [ ] Display a table/grid of Pokémon with data populated from https://pokeapi.co/docsv1/
- [ ] Fetch more results once the user scrolls near the bottom of the list of the results

#### Stretch Goals:

- [ ] Styling
- [ ] Testing
- [ ] Performance optimizations
- [ ] Precalculated maximum scroll height (no scrollbar jumping as the user scrolls through and more results added)
- [ ] Sorting (looks like the API docs don't mention sorting so this may be tricky)
- [ ] Individual Pokémon detail page
